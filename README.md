### Hi there 👋

Welcome, to my GitHub profile!

Here are some facts about me:

- 🇫🇷 I'm a (mostly) back-end developer based in Paris.
- 👨‍💻 My skills are focused on PHP & JavaScript (JS/TS) development
- 🐿️ I'm always looking for a cool side-project to work on

I'm the co-founder of [IMX Rarity](https://imxrarity.io), an NFT marketplace & ranking platform, built on the Immutable X blockchain.

📖 I write on Medium about technical subjects (and sometimes about other stuff), if you want to read me, [click here](https://medium.com/@edouard.courty)!

I also launched & participated in a few open-source projects (Formerly +300k downloads on user-instagram@npm)
